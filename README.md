# Hibikya Webpage
My project is based on revamping hibikya's webpage. Hibikya is one of Singapore's only Japanese drumming groups, and i wanted to revamp thier website to appeal to a wider audience.

## Design Process
I tried to go for a minimalistic design, as i wanted the webpage to be easily used by everyone from all different ages, Hence i felt that using a easy to use, simplistic design was the right way to go.

## Features
Existing Features
1. Nav bar to allow users easy access to the other webpages
2. Moving Nav bar allows users to save time as the nav bar will always be easily seen and used, due to it following the user as they scroll
3. Multiple Pages allows the users to get more information on the website.

## Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT

## Credits
The text in the about section was taken from hibikya.com.sg
The photos and videos used were also taken from hibikiya.com.sg
